Vulnerability Definition
        Without a Web Application Firewall, An attacker may try to inject various attack patterns either manually or using automated scanners. An automated scanner may send hordes of attack vectors and patterns to validate an attack, there are also chances for the application to get DoS`ed (Denial of Service)                                        
Vulnerability Remediation
        Web Application Firewalls offer great protection against common web attacks like XSS, SQLi, etc. They also provide an additional line of defense to your security infrastructure. This resource contains information on web application firewalls that could suit your application. https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/web-application-firewall
